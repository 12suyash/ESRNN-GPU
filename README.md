# A PyTorch implementation of the ES-RNN Hybrid Model

A GPU-enabled version of the [hybrid ES-RNN model](https://eng.uber.com/m4-forecasting-competition/) by Slawek et al that won the M4 time-series forecasting competition by a large margin. The details of our implementation and the results are discussed in detail on this [paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ivqoq7rl3jyxpmi/Redd-Khin-Marini-ESRNN.pdf?dl=0)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites


```
Python (3.5+)
PyTorch (0.4.1)
Zalando Research's Dilated RNN
```

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org) - The *data science* language ;)
* [PyTorch](https://www.pytorch.org/) - The dynamic framework for computation
