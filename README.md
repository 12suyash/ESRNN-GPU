# A PyTorch implementation of the ES-RNN Hybrid Model

A GPU-enabled version of the [hybrid ES-RNN model](https://eng.uber.com/m4-forecasting-competition/) by Slawek et al that won the M4 time-series forecasting competition by a large margin.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites


```
Python (3.5+)
